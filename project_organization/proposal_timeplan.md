# College Adviser

This project is done as part of the course Spoken Dialogue Systems. It aims to extend the existing [Adviser](https://digitalphonetics.github.io/adviser/) by including information on colleges in the US. Thus the college-adviser should represent a dialog system that helps a user to find a college according to their preferences.
